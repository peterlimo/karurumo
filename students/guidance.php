                                                <p><strong>College Life</strong></p>
                                                <p class="rtejustify">College life is a time of excitement and great change full of many opportunities. It is a transitional as well as a demanding stage of life that brings with it major changes and stress. These experiences can be challenging to our students and sometimes overwhelming especially when problems grow and appear impossible to handle. The new found freedom, demanding academic and other young adult responsibilities can impact smooth adjustment to campus life. Some of the approaches and solutions chosen by students in handling these difficulties can at times be, by themselves, problematic and worsen coping mechansms. Such unhealthy and unproductive coping styles can be substance use, poor nuitritional habbits, isolation, unprotected sexual encounters etc. However, such challenges may not be entirely avoided and need to be accepted as part of campus living and as the beginning of healing process and growth.</p>
                                                <p class="rtejustify">Students should find comfort and assurance that they are not alone as the counselling &nbsp;services are available to them for support at any time. The counselling &nbsp;office environment is a safe and friendly environment for students who wish to receive psychosocial support and help. Students are encouraged to visit the counselling &nbsp;offices where they will find professional and experienced counselors ready to listen, have confidential discussions and open conversations about their personal problems. Sometimes students may be in need of help but through others’(fellow students, friends, peers, faculty and other staff, family, spouse) observation of changes in behaviour and may recommend counselling . Suggestions by others should not be taken as an offense but as genuine brotherly and sisterly concerns for the students benefit. Laikipia College environment is another family home where we are each other’s brothers and sisters keepers.</p>

Counselling requires a very active presence, honesty, and openness in order to change maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and/or behavior. The counselor may challenge some of your assumptions or perceptions or propose different ways of looking at, thinking about, or handling situations, which can cause one to feel very upset, challenged, or disappointed. Attempting to resolve issues that brought one to therapy in the first place, such as personal or interpersonal relationships, may result in changes that were not originally intended. During the counselling process, the counselor is likely to draw on various approaches according to the problem that is being handled and his/her assessment of what will best benefit you.</p>
